<h2><u>The visionary</u></h2>
<img src="visionary.jpg"alt =width ="500" height ="200" /><p>The Visionary has a knack for analyzing problems and finding innovative ways to solve them. This keen analytical ability stems from three main characteristics. Firstly, ENTPs are innovative thinkers who enjoy studying problems and finding new ways to resolve them. Secondly, ENTPs are generally intelligent individuals who enjoy learning to better understand how things work. Thirdly, an ENTP loves nothing more than a good discussion or debate. While they are happy to agree to disagree, the act of discussion is something they will never shy away from.</p>

<h2><u>The Optimistic</h2></u>
<img src="optimistic.jpg"alt =""width ="500" height ="200" /><p>Optimism is a mental attitude characterized by hope and confidence in success and a positive future. Optimists tend to view hardships as learning experiences or temporary setbacks. Even the most miserable day holds the promise for them that "tomorrow will probably be better."</p>

<h2><u>The Chakra Hun</h2></u>

<img src="chakra.jpg"alt =""width ="500" height ="200" /><p>The 7 Chakras are an amazing description of life’s different rainbow colors; life’s different energies and aspects. In each of us, these different aspects and colors blend and express in a unique way that forms our original individuality. Each personality or soul has a unique “flavor”, an innate individuality, that manifests itself energetically as a unique pattern of activity in the different <i>Chakras</i>.</p>
